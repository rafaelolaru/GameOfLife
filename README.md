Project Specifications
Detailed Problem Description
The "Beehive Life" simulation project aims to create a dynamic representation of life within a beehive, akin to Conway's Game of Life, but with more complex rules and entity behaviors. The simulation begins with approximately 500 bees, categorized into different roles: Worker Bees, a Queen Bee, Male Bees (Drones), and Baby Bees (Larvae). Each category of bees has distinct behaviors and contributes differently to the hive's functionality and growth.

Worker Bees are primarily responsible for collecting food. Each day, a Worker Bee has a 75% chance of successfully gathering a unit of food. The hive needs these food units to sustain and grow. Specifically, every five units of food collected allows a new Baby Bee to be born. The Queen Bee, while she may have various functionalities in a real hive, will primarily be responsible for the birth of new bees in our simulation. Male Bees have the potential for different roles, but in the context of this simulation, they will primarily serve to ensure the hive's growth through mating with the queen.

The environment will also introduce variable elements that the bees must contend with, impacting their food gathering success rate and survival. These could include weather conditions, predators, or diseases. The simulation’s primary objective is to maintain the hive's health and promote its growth over time, despite these challenges.

Identified Potential Concurrency Issues
Concurrency issues will arise primarily around the food collection, storage, and consumption processes, as multiple bees will attempt to access and modify these shared resources simultaneously. For instance, there could be a race condition between Worker Bees trying to store food and Baby Bees being born (which consume food units).

Another critical area of concurrency will be the updating of each bee's status in the simulation. If multiple threads are handling different bees or bee types, synchronization issues might occur, leading to inaccurate representations of the hive's current state (e.g., the number of bees, food units, etc.).

Proposed Architecture by the Team
The project will be object-oriented, with distinct modules for different aspects of the hive and bee behaviors.

Modules and Classes:
Bee Classes: There will be a parent Bee class, with child classes like WorkerBee, QueenBee, MaleBee, and BabyBee, each with its unique attributes and methods.
Hive Resource Management: A module to manage shared resources within the hive, primarily the food units. This will need careful synchronization to avoid concurrency issues.
Environment Module: Handles the simulation of environmental factors (weather, diseases, etc.) that can affect the hive.
Simulation Engine: Coordinates the interactions between different entities and manages the progression of time within the simulation.
Threads:
Each category of bee can be operated by its thread, with synchronization mechanisms in place when interacting with shared resources like food units.
The environment could also have its thread, emitting different events that the bees must respond to.
Interactions:
Bees will interact with the environment and the hive's resources. For example, Worker Bees gathering food, or the impact of environmental factors on the bees.
The Simulation Engine will facilitate these interactions, ensuring the consistent and thread-safe update of the hive's state.
Entry-Point:
The system’s entry point will be the Simulation Engine, where the initial parameters of the hive (number of bees, food units, etc.) are set, and the simulation is started, managing the lifecycle of the threads and the progression of time.
This architecture is a starting point and will evolve as the project progresses and the team encounters new challenges or requirements.
